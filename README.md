Here’s a clear summary of what the task 5 notebook:
1. **Imports**

   * Loads the libraries used in the script:

     * `pandas` for data handling.
     * `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
     * `train_test_split`, `cross_val_score` for data splitting and cross-validation.
     * `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `plot_tree` for training and visualizing a decision tree.
     * `RandomForestClassifier` for the ensemble model.
     * `accuracy_score`, `classification_report` for model evaluation.
   * Purpose: bring in functions/classes needed for modeling, evaluation and visualization.

2. **Load dataset**

   * Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
   * Expected: a column named `target` (binary label) and several feature columns.
   * Purpose: get the data into memory for preprocessing and modeling.

3. **Define features (`X`) and target (`y`)**

   * `X` = all columns except `target`; `y` = the `target` column.
   * Purpose: separate predictors from the label so scikit-learn functions can use them.

4. **Train–test split**

   * Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%).
   * `stratify=y` keeps the same class distribution in train and test sets.
   * `random_state=42` makes the split reproducible.
   * Purpose: reserve unseen data (test set) to estimate generalization performance.

5. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**

   * Instantiates a decision tree and fits it to the training data.
   * Under the hood: the tree recursively finds feature thresholds that reduce impurity (Gini by default).
   * Purpose: learn a simple, interpretable model mapping features → target.

6. **Predict & evaluate the Decision Tree**

   * Uses the trained tree to predict on the test set.
   * Computes `accuracy_score` and prints `classification_report`:

     * `precision`, `recall`, `f1-score`, and `support` for each class.
   * Purpose: quantify how well the tree performs and inspect per-class performance (not just accuracy).

7. **Visualize the Decision Tree**

   * Renders a plotted view of the tree (limited to first 3 levels via `max_depth=3`).
   * The plot shows split conditions, number of samples per node, and class distributions (color/labels).
   * Purpose: interpret model decisions and spot suspiciously deep/complex splits that indicate overfitting.

8. **Control overfitting (pruned tree)**

   * Creates a new Decision Tree with `max_depth=4` and fits it.
   * Prints the pruned tree’s accuracy on test data.
   * Rationale: limiting depth reduces model variance (less overfitting). Compare pruned vs full tree to see if pruning improves test performance.

9. **Train a Random Forest**

   * Instantiates a Random Forest with 100 trees (`n_estimators=100`) and fits it.
   * A Random Forest builds many trees on bootstrap samples and aggregates their votes → usually more stable and often more accurate than a single tree.
   * Purpose: get a stronger baseline model and reduce variance compared to a single decision tree.

10. **Predict & evaluate the Random Forest**

    * Predicts on the test set, prints accuracy and classification report for the forest.
    * Purpose: compare the forest’s performance to the (pruned) decision tree to see which generalizes better.

11. **Feature importances (Random Forest)**

    * Extracts `feature_importances_` from the trained forest and builds a sorted table.
    * Plots a horizontal bar chart (top features on top via inverted y-axis).
    * Interpretation notes:

      * Higher importance → feature contributed more to decreasing impurity across the forest.
      * Importances are relative; correlated features can share importance and may mask true causality.
    * Purpose: get a quick sense of which features the forest considers most predictive.

12. **Cross-validation**

    * Runs 5-fold cross-validation (`cv=5`) for the pruned decision tree and the random forest.
    * `cross_val_score` trains/validates the model across 5 splits and returns scores; the script prints the mean score.
    * Purpose: obtain a more robust estimate of average model performance (less variance than a single train/test split).
